Is it bad?\nAm I simply going mad?\nIs it fiction or fact?\nAm I really losing tact?\nIs he magical, logical, natural? I wonder\nHe's got the makings of my seventh wonder\nOoh hoo… hoo… hoo…\n\nSeventy three kisses for me\nThat whisper through the silence his feelings for me\nSoftly he dips my cherry-red lips\nIn the essence of a hope on which my love can float\n\nHis passion burns and my luck takes a turn\nI'm reborn and alive with his love to survive\n\nIs it good? Is it bad?\nAm I simply going mad?\nIs it fiction or fact?\nAm I really losing tact?\nIs he magical, logical, natural? I wonder\nHe's got the makings of my seventh wonder\n\nOn seven seas we sail on this dream\nTurning it into virtual reality\nReality\n\nIs it good? Is it bad?\nAm I simply going mad?\nIs it fiction or fact?\nAm I really losing tact?\n(Is he magical?) Magical\n(Logical, natural? I wonder)\nHe's got the makings of my seventh wonder\n\nAm I weak? Am I strong?\nIn his arms do I belong?\nI could climb mountain high\nFor his love I'd learn to fly\nIs he magical, logical, natural? I wonder\nHe's got the makings of my seventh wonder\n(Is he fiction or a matter of fact?)\nSeventh wonder\n(Iѕ he fiction or a matter of fаct?)\nSeventh wonder"
