Bring the moon to the moonless sky\nYeah, I see – the stakes are high, but this story ends with no goodbye\nGirl, I'm qualified, I get what I see, no need to try\nI'll make sure your dreams will never die\n\nKill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips\nStare me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs\nKill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips\nStare me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs\n\nAngel in disguise, angel in disguise\nI said spread your wings and fly, spread your wings and fly\nAngel in disguise, ooh angel in disguise\nSpread your wingѕ аnd fly"
