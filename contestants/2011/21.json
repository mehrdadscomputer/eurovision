What about my dreams?\nWhat about how I feel? What about my needs?\nI can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free\nWhat about how I feel? What about my life?\n\n(I can't) Can't\n(Hold back) Back\n(No more)\n(I can't) I can't\n(Hold back) Hold back\n(No more)\n\nTíz lépés, száz lépés távolság kell\nNem számít merre csak el, tőled el\nMit mondhatnál, mit mondhatnék\nElkoptunk rég, szemeinkből nézd, hova tűnt a fény?\n\nWhat about my life? What about my dreams?\nWhat about how I feel? What about my needs?\nI can't hold back, I can't go back, I must be free\nWhat about how I feel? What about my life?\n\n(I can't hold back) Gonna live my dreams\n(I won't go back) Oh, my dreams\n(I need to be all I can be) Gonna live my life\n(I can't hold back) I can't go back\n(I won't go back) I must be free\n(I need to be all I can be) What about my dreаmѕ?"
