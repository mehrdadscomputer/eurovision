Are you coming with me? - I know you will\nWe can search the world together, come on, baby, now or never\n\nWhat you give is what you get - there ain't no regrets\n\nIf you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky\nBecause I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime\nRead my mind\n\nIf you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky\nBecause I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime\nRead my mind\n\nI believe there's a better place always somewhere else instead\nI believe the grass is greener if I chase the magic no one else can find\n(The magic no one else can find)\n\nIf you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky\nBecause I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime\nRead my mind\n\nIf you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky\nBecause I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime\nRead my mind\n\nBecause I'm ѕeventeen only once in а lifetime"
