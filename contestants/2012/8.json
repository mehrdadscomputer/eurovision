King without a throne\nYou're great, but not impressive, lots of up and low\nIt's so typical: when it's time to go\nYou knock me on the floor – my heart goes boom, boom, boom\n\n(Day and night, it's a fight) Don't know where to start\nWhen you're close I'm far, no no no no\n(Day and night, it's a lie) I dried my tears, but you want more\n\nL'amore è femmina, se non riceve non si da\n(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)\nClean up the mess you left, I'm out of love and it's a fact\n(You left, out of love and it's a fact)\nI'm sure you'll smile, ready to go\nYou're an independent grown man after all\nOut of love, must have been sent from up above\nLala lala lala la...\n\nMa che caldo fa, ooh...\nI'll let you think twice, I don't wanna cause any pressure\nBut have you asked yourself why I bought a brand new gun shot\n\nL'amore è femmina, e non riceve non si da\n(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)\nLa prendo comoda, calcolo le possibilità\n(Tic tac, una possibilità)\nQuello che vuoi se non ce l'hai\nSiamo tutti insoddisfatti, come mai?\nFemmina, se non riceve non ѕi da\nLala lala lala lа..."
