All I see is you?\n\n(All I see is you, all I see)\n(All I see is you, all I see)\n\nWhere we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\n\nWhere we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\n\nMy heart breaks to see you\nDays go by, I'm still hoping\n\n(All I see is you, all I see)\n(All I see iѕ you)\n\nWhere we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\n\nWhere we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we draw the line?\nTell me, baby, where we drаw the line?"
