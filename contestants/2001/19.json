Tell me\n\n(How long will I wait for you?) Too long for you\n(How long will you wait for me?) Oh... too long for me\n(How long is too long, yeah?) Too long, yeah\nWe've been wastin' so much time\nLife's too short – it would be a crime\n\nSo who's behind the mask? Oh... you don't have to ask\nI'll tell you all there is about me, my cards are on the table\nAnd I have really learnt to hide these feelings deep inside\nI know the honesty within is nothing when you're cryin'\n\nI've been a faker, yeah, someone who didn't care\nAnd I would never want to be with someone like me\n(Be with someone like me)\nBut maybe one more night could make us feel all right\nWhat difference does it make?
