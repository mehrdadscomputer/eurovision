Why did you leave last night?\nIs it all just a game? – Oh… tell me why we can't be lovers\n\nI do believe in the two of us\nThat you and me – we are the only ones\nAnd we were meant to be true, so tell me why we can't be lovers\n\nHow could I be such a fool\nI thought I already knew it all, but I know\nI was totally wrong\n\nListen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion – I know it's inside you\n\nHow will I know if you're fooling me?\nMaybe I'm wrong, but it seems to be\nLike it's all just a game, and I just want us to be lovers\n\nWe had it all in our hands\nJust like those all happy ends\nI still don't know why, but we lost it somehow\n\nListen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion – I know it's inside you\n\nOne more chance to make a try\nNothing left to do for you and I\n\nListen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher\nFollow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger\nListen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you\nHold on to devotion – I know it's inside you\n\nLiѕten to your heartbeаt"
