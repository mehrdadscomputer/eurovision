Yeah, isn't it crazy?\nIt's all because of you…\nAll because of you…\n\nIt's all because of you… oh…\nAll because of you… oh…\nI know that if the sky would fall, I'd survive it all\nBecause of you… oh…\n\nI reach for the horizon\nWhenever I've got days of doubt\nBringing me down\n\nSo even if disaster strikes\nI close my eyes and then I'm next to you\nI'm right there with you, hey\n\nYeah, isn't it crazy? Yeah, isn't it crazy?\nIt's all because of you…\nAll because of you…\n\nIt's all because of you… oh…\nAll because of you… oh…\nI know that if the sky would fall, I'd survive it all\nBecause of you… oh…\n\nIt's all 'cause of you\nBecause of you (Hey, hey)\nBecause of you (Hey)\nIt's all 'cause of you…\n\nI know that if the sky would fall, I'd survive it all\nBecause of you, oh…\n\nIt's all because of you… oh…\nAll because of you… oh…\nI know that if the sky would fall, I'd survive it all\nBecauѕe of you… oh…\n(Hey yeah, hey yeаh, hey…)"
