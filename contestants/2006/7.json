Will you ever save my storming soul?\nI need to know\n\nShould I live, should I die without your love?\nShould I smile, should I cry without your love?\nShould I fall, should I fly without your love?\nAll I can is only living for you, breathing for you\n\nWhat I lose, what I find without your love?\nWhat I say, what I hide without your love?\nWhat I have in my mind without your love?\nTell me what I have to do, since I love you\n\nFly with me, take my wings and dream away\nThe stars will lead to the heavens' way\nOne's for sure:\nThere's a thousand ways to say goodbye\nWhat you'll decide?\n\nShould I live, should I die without your love?\nShould I smile, should I cry without your love?\nShould I fall, should I fly without your love?\nAll I can is only living for you, breathing for you\n\nWhat I lose, what I find without your love?\nWhat I say, what I hide without your love?\nWhat I have in my mind without your love?\nTell me what I have to do, since I love you\n\nShould I live, should I die without your love?\nShould I smile, should I cry without your love?\nShould I fall, should I fly without your love?\nAll I can is only living for you, breathing for you\n\nShould I live, should I die without your love?\nShould I smile, should I cry without your love?\nShould I fall, should I fly without your love?\nAll I can is only living for you, breathing for you\n\nWhat I lose, what I find without your love?\nWhat I say, what I hide without your love?\nWhat I have in my mind without your love?\nTell me what I have to do, becаuѕe I love you"
