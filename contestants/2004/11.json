Or destiny?\nDo you take me for a ride?\nPlease, tell me now\n\nYou're the air, you're the love that I breathe\n(That sounds so good)\nYou're the magic that flows from within\n(I feel that too)\nWe come close, then we move far away\nCan't we stay together?\n\nOn again, off again\nLike the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide\nFind an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove is a flame that we can never tame\nOn again, off again\n\nThere's a river between us\nAnd I need you to come across\nReach out for my heart\nKeep this feeling so alive\nLove grows, we survive\n\nOn again, off again\nLike the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide\nFind an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove is a flame that we can never tame\nOn again, off again\n\nOff again, on again\nLike a flickering flame\nThat dies in the wind\nAnd lights up again\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove iѕ a flame we can never tame\nOn again, off again\n\nOn again, off agаin"
