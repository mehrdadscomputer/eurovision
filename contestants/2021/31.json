Just imagine it\nNot until the storm has passed\nNot until it's quiet\nCan the heart that's broken cry\n\nHallelujah\nWe're glorious\n(Hallelujah) Oh, yeah\nThe day is dawning\nThe storm's relentless\nBut everybody knows\nEverybody knowѕ we're born to the fight\n\nHey child\nWhy yа hidin' from the light?"
