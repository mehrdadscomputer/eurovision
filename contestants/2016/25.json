Oh…\n\nSomehow we will change everything that we touch\nBut we held on too tight and changed it too much\nWe sweep up this love, put the pieces back together\nAnd if we find them all can we bring this to life?\n\nOur life won't wait for us to live\nWe don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss\nThe love we get is the love we give\nA money chest full of love but we hid the key\n\nThis is the ghost of you\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're lonely in a crowded room together\nTell me who's scared now\n\nThis is the ghost of you\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're playing house in these walls forever\nTell me who's scared now\n\nCan't we get an alternate ending?\nCan't we get an alternate ending? Oh…\nCan't we get an alternate ending?\nCan't we get an alternate ending? Oh…\n\nThis is the ghost of you\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're lonely in a crowded room together\nTell me who's scared now\n\nThis is the ghost of you\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're playing house in these walls forever\nTell me who's scared now\n\nThis is the ghost of you (Ah…)\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're lonely in a crowded room together\nTell me who's scared now\n\nThis is the ghost of you (Tell me who's scared now)\nHaunting the ghost of me\nWe're playing house in these walls forever\nTell me who's ѕcаred now"
