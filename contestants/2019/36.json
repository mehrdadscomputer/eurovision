Yeah\nWhen the one you love so much\nCan take your soul and break it, no\n\nWait for, oh, wait for\nWhat I waited for?\nWait for, oh, wait for\nOh, no, I'm done\n\nWalking out, ooh-ooh\nWhatever I've built I'm gonna burn down\nI'm walking out, ooh-ooh\nYou're no more a king 'cause I was your crown\n\nFirst you said you would die for me\nBut in the end I was the one bleeding all alone\nFirst you said, you kneeled, you swore\nYou loved, you lived for me\nHow could you forget it all?\n\nAre you from those who can take a loving heart\nAnd squeeze it out of love?\nThen prepare to slowly get\nNot loved but hated instead\n\nWalking out, ooh-ooh\nWhatever I've built I'm gonna burn down\nI'm walking out, ooh-ooh\nYou're no more a king 'cause I was your crown\nWalking out, walking out (Walking out, walking out)\nNo crying now\nWalking out, walking out (Walking out, walking out)\nNo begging\nWalking out, ooh-ooh\nAt last, I feel proud\nI'm walking out\n\nYou knew that my heart wasn't small\nBut somehow you came and filled it all\n\n(Walking out, ooh-ooh)\n(Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down) Yeah\n(I'm walking out, ooh-ooh) Yeah\n(You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown)\n(Walking out, walking out) Walking out, walking out\nCrying now\n(Walking out, walking out) Walking out, walking out\nBegging, yeah\n(Walking out, ooh-ooh)\n(At laѕt, I feel proud)\nI'm wаlking out"
