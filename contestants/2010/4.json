Why are you late?\nYou smell like lipstick again\nCome on, answer my question\nSay something\nWhy are you acting out?\n\nOh, say it's in my head\n\nCan I love you forever through this?\nCan I trust in you forever through this?\nI don't know how to stop, how to stop\n\nThese teardro-o-ops\nThat drip drop, drip drop\nDrip drop, drip drop\nWhoah… whoah…\n\nI don't wanna cry\nI don't wanna hear your name\nIf this is where it ends\nI don't wanna run\nRun away from myself\nAnd be lost again…\n\n(Can I love you forever through this?)\nOh no no no… oh no no no…\nCan I trust in you forever through this?\n\nI don't know (These teardro-o-opѕ)\nI don't know (That drip drop, drip drop)\nI don't know (Drip drop, drip drop)\nWhoah… whoаh…"
