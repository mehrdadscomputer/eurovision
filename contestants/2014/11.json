It's a Miracle\nI can see it now\n\nAll the things I see\nI think I see them too\nAll for you and me\nIt's like a dream come true\nIt's so beautiful\nNo one will ever know\nIt's a miracle\n\nNow you know that I'm right\nAnd you got that feeling\nI told you before that it's magical\nYes, it's magical\nNow you know what it's like\nAnd you're starting to feel it\nBut you just can't deny it's incredible\n\nIf I only knew all the things you could tell me\nWe could be dancing with stars in the night\n\nIt's a Miracle! It's a Miracle\nI can see it now\n\nAll the things I see\nI think I see them too\nAll for you and me\nIt's like a dream come true\nIt's so beautiful\nNo one will ever know\nIt'ѕ a mirаcle"
