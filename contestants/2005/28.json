Can you feel it?\nDo you think you're strong enough?\n\nCan you take the highs?\nCan you take the lows?\nCan you handle everything love throws?\n\nLove can build you up\nLove can tear you down\nLove can change the world\nThis is what I've found\n\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you cry\nLove can be the best\nUntil it's passed you by\n(Love, love, love)\n\nIf you want it, come and get it\nEven though you know the score\nI will love you, I will hate you\nThen I'll love you even more\n\nCan you handle love?\nCan you handle pain?\nCan you handle everything I'm sayin'?\n\nLove can build you up\nLove can tear you down\nLove can change the world\nThis is what I've found\n\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you cry\nLove can be the best\nUntil it's passed you by\n(Love, love, love)\n\nLove will capture you whole\nWith your body and soul\nLove is taking control of your senses\n\nLove is guilty as tried\nLove has no alibi\nLove is breaking down all your defences\nLove\n\nLove can make you sorry\nLove can make you weep\nLove can take you over\nEven when you sleep\n\nLove can give you heaven\nLove can make you high\nLove can make you cheat\nAnd love can make you lie\n\nLove can build you up\nLove can tear you down\nLove can change the world\nThis is what I've found\n\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you cry\nLove can be the best\nUntil it's pаsѕed you by"
