(Cool vibes)\nCool vibes, why don't you kill me?\nAll that I can see are shadows of my destiny (Oh oh...)\n\nDon't want you to make me feel afraid\nDon't need you to take away the hate\nBut I know that you will break the seal of mystery\nLeave it to my fantasy, what will be?\n\nCool vibes, why don't you kill me?\nCool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away?\nCan't you see we're free to die?\nCool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray (Oh oh...)\n\nCool vibes, why don't you thrill me? (Cool vibes)\nCool vibes, why don't you kill me?\nAll that I can see are shadows of my destiny\n\nStay close to me, infinity\nEnigma's what we share\nBut I don't care\nYou'll be there\n\nCool vibes, why don't you kill me? (Cool vibes)\nCool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away?\nCan't you see we're free to die?\nCool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray\n(For some broken heroes)\n\nCool vibes, why don't you thrill me? (Cool vibes)\nCool vibes, why don't you kill me? (Cool vibes)\nAll that I can see are shаdows of my deѕtiny"
